Welcome to the PCB Workshop README! Here's a quick rundown of what you can expect:

Introduction to PCB Design: PCBs are like the backbone of electronic devices, providing a platform for connecting all the parts together. We'll cover the basics of designing these circuit boards, from creating layouts of pathways for electricity to flow to getting them ready for manufacturing.

Analog Circuit: Half-Wave Rectifier: In this part, we'll dive into designing a circuit that converts alternating current (AC) to direct current (DC). It's a fundamental circuit used in many electronic devices, and we'll show you how to build one.

Digital Circuit: 4:2 Encoder: Ever wonder how computers encode data? We'll explore this with a 4:2 encoder circuit, which takes inputs and translates them into a two-bit binary output. It's a neat way of compressing data, and we'll guide you through making your own.

Simulation Using Tinkercad: Before we get into building actual circuits, we'll simulate everything using Tinkercad. It's an online tool that lets you test circuits virtually, so you can see how they behave without touching any hardware.

PCB Design Using EasyEDA: Once we've nailed down our designs in Tinkercad, we'll move on to EasyEDA for PCB design. This web-based tool helps us turn our circuit schematics into actual PCB layouts, complete with components and connections.

Workshop Goals: By the end of this workshop, you'll be comfortable creating schematic diagrams, turning them into PCB layouts, understanding the ins and outs of PCB design, and simulating circuit behavior.
